# Habit Tracker

Establishing and sustaining positive habits is essential for a healthy and successful life. Our Habit Tracker simplifies this process by helping you manage, monitor, and visualize your progress.

Developed as part of the IU Akademie DLBDSOOFPP01 course, this program utilizes Python 3.9.

## Core Functionality
The habit tracker allows you to:
* Create a habit
* Delete a habit or category
* Define periodicity of habits (Daily, Weekly, Monthly)
* Add habit categories for reference
* Mark habits as completed

### Progress and Streak Tracking
Additionally, you can:
* View all created habits
* View habits for a specific period
* View streaks of all habits
* View the longest streak of a specific habit
* View the streak history of a specific habit

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.9+

## Installing
Install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and ensure "ADD to path" is checked during installation.

Next, install the following libraries:

- Questionary:
  ```
  pip install questionary
  ```

### Packages for Running Tests
To run tests, install:
- Pytest:
  ```
  pip install -U pytest
  ```
